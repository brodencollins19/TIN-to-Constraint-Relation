-This python program takes as input a text file containing the vertices of triangles for a triangular irradiated network and will produce a constraint database relation describing the network. 

-Usage: "python tin.py tin.txt" where tin.txt is the input file. The default encoding is used for the MLPQ database system developed at the University of Nebraska Lincoln: https://cse.unl.edu/~revesz/MLPQ/Instruction.htm

-An example input file "tin.txt" as well as it's corresponding constraint database output have been provided.
